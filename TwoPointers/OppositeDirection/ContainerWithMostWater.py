# You are given an integer array height of length n.
# There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
# Notice that you may not slant the container.
# O(1) Memory Required -> Involves Monotonic Condition -> Two Pointers
# Time Complexity: O(N) Space Complexity: O(1)
